# Who Wants to be a Millionaire ?
ðŸš¨**Required** 
"Who Want to be a Millionaire?" is a British television show first created by David Briggs, Steven Knight and Mike Whitehill for the ITV network in 1998. This application is just a clone of that concept. In simple words, a game in which the participant should answer 15 questions to get to the one million prize. 

The game is divided into 3 sections of questions 5 questions for each level(Easy, Medium and Hard). The game will be terminated whenever a player chooses a wrong option for the shown question. 

When the game starts there are 4 option to choose from. 1. Player can start the game. 2 Player can show the rules under How to play section. 3 Showing the scoring board sorted from the highest to the lowest. 4 Quitting the game. 

If a player chooses to start the game, s/he needs to type his full name and his country. Theses information will be saved in the scoring board.

## Flowchart of the Game:

In Software industry, it is extremely important to have a complete understanding of when the process starts and when it ends as well as what happens in between. Following flowchart shows how the play begins and when it ends.

====================================== The Sections you Fill in are below ==============================


## How To Play/Use
ðŸš¨**Required** 

When the Game starts it does execute the following steps before the player is able to type an choice. First of all it reads the questions text files and split them into lists preparing them for inserting in the Google drive sheets. Only if the google sheets allocated for the questions are empty, the population process will be executed. Each question sheet has 20 question. There are 3 types of questions (Easy, Medium and Hard)

How to play when game starts?

    1- Choose one of the options 1,2,3 or 4 
    2- To start the game choose 1 . This option will be forwarded to ask the player to type his name and his country and press enter key after each input.
    3- Console will be cleared and a line at the top of the console will be shown with player name, country, score and question level
    4- A question will be shown with 4 options 1 to 4 . Player can type his option by pressing keys of 1 to 4 .
    5- In case the option is the same as the right answer, the score will be incremented, console will be cleared and a new question will be shown.
    6- In case the option isn't right, the game will be terminated indicating the player loses the round and his current score. 
    7- If player chooses the second option, the rules and How-to instructions are going to be shown. Player can also either end the game by pressing e or going back to the menu by pressing y
    8- When the third option is clicked the scoring board will be loaded from the google sheet and it is sorted based on the score 
    9- If player chooses to quit the game, s/he should only choose number 4 and game will be terminated.

## Features
ðŸš¨**Required** 


### Implemented Features
ðŸš¨**Required** 

From a developer point of view this version of the game implements the concept of the OOP and makes use of the class concept. Player as well as Question both have their separated files and initialized in another procedural python file.

Another Feature is the validation process of user input, either whe Player still at the main menu of the game or when the question is displayed. The validation process makes use of the Regular Expressions.

Safety Score Calculation: when player loses the round a call to the player object and let it check the last score the player has got. If it is more than 1000 then 1000 will be his last score instead of 0. In the same manner when player loses the round and his is at questions more than 10, player will get back to 32000 instead of 0 or 1000 .

Last but not least, the game makes use of the live score tracking. In other words, whenever the player gets the right answer for the shown question, h/his score is going to be incremented (make use of the player object implemented methods) and shown right at the top of the game. 


### Future Features
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

The possibility for the player to remove two wrong options will be a good future feature to implement later on. This feature will be available be the medium and hard questions and only to be used once in the whole round.


## Flow Chart
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

The following flow chart shows how the game starts and what happen by choosing options 

![game Flow Chart](assets/README/who_wants_to_be_a_millionaire.png)

## Data Model/ Classes
ðŸš¨**Required** 

In this section write our your data model(s) or classes. 

You might want to include subsections that include how the data in the model is initialized and then the methods that you created to update it through the program.


You can create a table and take a screenshot, or you can write up subsections in markdown:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/130148204-b56406bf-0fff-48f3-9dee-2f3cdbe67cc5.png)

### Class X
To better group the game as an object, I wrote a class representing its properties and had method functions to update those properties: 

**Properties**
- property 1: is a {string} it represents {something} 
- property 2: is a {string} it represents {something} 

**Methods**
- **\_\_init\_\_**: Initialize method, it starts the class off with default parameters as if a user just started to play a game.
- **\_\_str\_\_**: Returns a string representation of the class/object

## Libraries used
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

List out the python libraries you purposefully used in your project and why. You can look at your requirements.txt file and go back to https://pypi.org/ to rediscover the purpose of a library if needed.

A bulleted list is a good presentation for this information.

## Testing
ðŸš¨**Required** 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your features and ensure that they all work as intended in an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


### Validation Testing
ðŸš¨**Required** 

You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

For each python file in your project, paste it into [CI's pep8 tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), and take a screenshot of the linter output showing NO ERRORS

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/212106175-36b2f18a-7c75-458d-94dd-9886e81c71f3.png)

Ideally you would have no errors remaining outside of line too long which you can fix by 

adding
```$python 
# noqa
```
There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.

Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why.

### Manual Testing
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Use Markdown to track how you tested each bit of user input for each valid option, various invalid entries and leading/trailing spaces

**Feature 1**
- [ ] invalid entry, says sorry and re-prompts
- [ ] no entry, says sorry and re-prompts
- [ ] alpha when numeric expected, sorry and re-prompts
- [ ] valid entry with leading spaces, trimmed and shows proper next stage
- [ ] valid entry with trailing spaces, trimmed and shows proper next stage

You should also call out how you tested any other features such as:
- Welcome Message, recaps username
- Score update shows current score
- color change for correct vs incorrect
- google sheet updated properly

If you prefer spreadsheets, create a google-sheet and link to it in this section, just make sure you update the permissions to allow anyone to view it. You can make a [COPY of this example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_JUmFfzHVtXdHse6ib82BGnRMPlPqufSOnAVN3bVl8/edit?usp=sharing) and update it as your own. Just make sure you share it to anyone with the link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_JUmFfzHVtXdHse6ib82BGnRMPlPqufSOnAVN3bVl8/edit?usp=sharing

### Defect Tracking
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Try to create issues in real time as it better reflects the daily life of a developer.

The easiest way to track defects is by using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them. At this stage you don't need a custom template or labels, that comes in P4.

 Here's a [guide to GitHub Defects](Defects.md)

### Defects of Note
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and link to them directly here.


### Outstanding Defects
ðŸš¨**Required** 

It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found as long as:
- it does not impact a user from completing a vital function on the website
- it only affects a very small subset of users
- is an extreme edge case that very few users would try
- there is an open issue against a framework, browser or technology used

If you know of something that isn't quite right, create an issue and link to it here and explain why you chose not to resolve it. 

Sometimes it's as simple, word wrapping issue that makes the site look odd at a certain screensize that you just didn't have time to fix due to the impending deadline it's best to mention it but note why you allowed it to go live: "Yes it looks odd, but it doesn't impact core functionality of the site." than to let the accessors think you didn't notice it. 

### Commenting Code
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Make sure you use triple double quotes to document functions and classes.
 Here'a  documentation worthy example:
```$python
def yes_no(question):
    """
    Function to ask a simple yes no question of the user.
    :param question: String displayed as the question
    :return: answer: String equal to "1" or "2" representing yes or no respectfully
    """
    print(question)
    print("yes = 1")
    print("no = 2")
    answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    while answer not in ("1", "2"):
        print("please choose 1 for yes and 2 for no")
        answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    return answer

```

3. The downloaded credentialsJSON file is basically your creds.json file that you need to put into your heroku settings or gitpod environment to access your google drive.

4. Google Sheet Template
  - If you had to create specific sheets for your project, instruct users to make their own copy of it from yours and rename it back to what the python project expects
  - And don't forget to share the spreadsheet in question with the client_email from the creds.json 

### Gitpod
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in gitpod.  Such as install requirements.txt  and setting up a creds.json file that is in the gitignore and keeping their workspace.

If you have project settings required such as a creds.json file from the GOOGLE DRIVE API acess, please provide an example of that file in the writeup with the project key values:
```$python
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",

    "clien_x509_cert_url": "<YOUR_VALUE>"
}
```

If you have any dependencies, you should instruct users to install them
```$python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Heroku
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to Heroku. Include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

You may want to re-watch the [python essentials deployment video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LS101+2021_T1/courseware/293ee9d8ff3542d3b877137ed81b9a5b/e3b664e16366444c8d722c5d8340b340/?child=first) when writing up this section.


If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values.
Do not share your personal keys but either cut them out of the screen shot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such values.

1. Fork the repository

Make a fork so you have a copy of the repository in your own git hub account: https://github.com/maliahavlicek/portfolio_project_03
